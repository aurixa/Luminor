# Luminor

A web-based 3D game built with Three.js, created entirely through AI collaboration.

## About

Luminor is an innovative web-based game that leverages the power of Three.js to create immersive 3D experiences. This project is unique in that it's being developed entirely through AI-assisted programming, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development.

## Technology Stack

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Vite for development and building

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system
2. Double-click the `Luminor.command` file to start the game
3. The game will open automatically in your default browser
4. When you're done playing, simply close the terminal window

## Development Status

This project is currently in active development. Features include:
- Procedurally generated spherical world
- Dynamic lighting system
- Resource collection mechanics
- Smooth player controls

## License

This project is open source and available under the MIT License.

## Concept

Luminor takes the classic snake mechanic into a unique 3D environment - a procedurally generated spherical world. Players navigate the planet's surface, collecting glowing energy to grow longer.

A fixed light source (the sun) illuminates one portion of the planet, creating a distinct light/dark dichotomy that influences gameplay.
