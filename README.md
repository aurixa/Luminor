# Luminor

A web-based 3D game built with Three.js, created entirely through AI collaboration.

## About

Luminor is an innovative web-based game that leverages the power of Three.js to create immersive 3D experiences. This project is unique in that it's being developed entirely through AI-assisted programming, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development.

## Technology Stack

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- More technologies will be added as the project evolves

## Development Status

This project is currently in its initial development phase. Stay tuned for updates!

## License

This project is open source and available under the MIT License.

## Concept

Luminor takes the classic snake mechanic into a unique 3D environment - a procedurally generated spherical world. Players navigate the planet's surface, collecting glowing energy to grow longer.

A fixed light source (the sun) illuminates one portion of the planet, creating a distinct light/dark dichotomy that influences gameplay.
