# Luminor Game Improvements

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. ESLint Configuration
- ✅ Added ESLint v9 configuration using the new flat config format
- ✅ Configured appropriate code quality and style rules
- ✅ Set up rule overrides for specific files (e.g., gameLoop.js allowing console logs)
- ✅ Added npm scripts for linting (`npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix`)

### 2. TypeScript Integration
- ✅ Added TypeScript and type definitions for three.js
- ✅ Created comprehensive tsconfig.json with appropriate settings
- ✅ Set up core type definitions in src/types.d.ts
- ✅ Created TypeScript conversion utility script
- ✅ Set up Vite to handle TypeScript files
- ✅ Converted index.ts, game.ts, controls.ts, sceneSetup.ts, gameLoop.ts, interface.ts and constants.ts
- ✅ Added type safety with null checks and proper interfaces
- ✅ All TypeScript validation passing with `tsc --noEmit`

### 3. Code Organization
- ✅ Created CODE_ORGANIZATION.md with comprehensive structure
- ✅ Defined clear module responsibilities
- ✅ Established coding guidelines for the project
- ✅ Prepared pathways for better separation of concerns

### 4. Build Process Optimization
- ✅ Created BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md with detailed recommendations
- ✅ Configured Vite for better development experience
- ✅ Added sourcemaps for better debugging
- ✅ Updated resolution settings for TypeScript/JavaScript files

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed "callbacks is not defined" Error
- **Issue**: The game was crashing when clicking the START GAME button with "Uncaught ReferenceError: callbacks is not defined at startGame"
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a global `gameCallbacks` variable
  - Initialized it in `initializeGame()`
  - Ensured proper reference in `startGame()`
  - Reordered UI setup to occur after callback initialization

### 2. TypeScript Type Safety Improvements
- Added null checks throughout the codebase
- Ensured proper typing for callback functions
- Added optional chaining for safer property access
- Added more comprehensive interface definitions
- Fixed optional parameter handling in callbacks

## Next Steps

1. **Continue TypeScript Migration**
   - Convert remaining core files (main.js, player.js, resources.js)
   - Convert planet, player, and rendering modules
   - Update imports to remove .js extensions

2. **Implement Code Organization Plan**
   - Restructure according to CODE_ORGANIZATION.md
   - Create appropriate subdirectories
   - Refactor components for better separation of concerns

3. **Add Build Optimizations**
   - Implement code splitting as outlined in BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md
   - Add asset optimization
   - Configure environment-specific builds

4. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
   - Add instanced rendering for similar objects
   - Improve memory management with proper disposal

## Running the Game

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run start` 
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
4. Run linting checks: `npm run lint`
5. Fix linting issues: `npm run lint:fix`
6. Check TypeScript types: `npm run typecheck`
