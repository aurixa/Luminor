## Next Steps

1. **Convert JavaScript Files to TypeScript**
   - Run the conversion script: `npm run convert-to-ts`
   - Add type annotations to files gradually
   - Update imports to remove .js extensions

2. **Implement Code Organization**
   - Restructure according to the organization plan
   - Move files to their appropriate directories
   - Update imports to reflect new structure

3. **Apply Build Optimizations**
   - Implement code splitting in vite.config.js
   - Add asset optimization
   - Set up environment-specific builds

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
   - Add instanced rendering for similar objects
   - Set up proper asset loading with progress indicators

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Set up unit testing framework
   - Add integration tests
